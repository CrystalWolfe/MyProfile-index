 <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
 <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
 <p>My interest in IT has evolved since I was young. I first began my interest
    in IT because of the challenges that came with figuring out how to fix a
    computer that is malfunctioning and the determination to figure it out.
    Now included in interest is my determination to understand how cybersecurity
    works to protect a user from online criminal activity. When looking into my
    experiences in IT, I have barely any experience except for what I learnt in
    the first few weeks of University but with my fascination and determination
    I am willing to learn about all the challenges and experiences that come with
    going into the IT world. </p>

  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>The reason I choose to come to RMIT is because the Bachelor of IT was seen
    as one of the best programs RMIT has to offer. It is also because RMIT is
    seen as one of top University that can help you find the skills you need to
    use that would enable the student to become job ready. If done correctly you
    would be able to have a job after graduating from RMIT. The services are
    also superb at RMIT as you are always reminded of all the services we can
    have throughout the semester from students and professors which shows that
    if you ever need them they are easy to access. </p>

  <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
  <p>In this Bachelor of IT course, I expect to learn a lot about how a
    computer operates and works. This includes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to program applications or just programming in general,</li>
    <li>How to make a web page through AWS,</li>
    <li>How databases are created and managed,</li>
    <li>How the internet and the World Wide Web is used,</li>
    <li>What is cybersecurity and how does it fight cybercrimes.</li>
  </ul>
   <p>I really want to learn about security because I have always had a
    fascination in security and crimes for as long as I could remember and
    would like to know how a user is protected and if any of the cybercrimes
    are similar to crimes done to a person. </p>

 <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>My ideal job would be working for a company or organiasation such as ASIO
   that helps protect our citizens from cybercrimes. ASIO stand for Australia
   Security Itelligence Organisation. I would like to work for ASIO under their
   Technologist Graduate Program <a href ="https://www.careers.asio.gov.au/public/jncustomsearch.viewFullSingle?in_organid=12852&in_jnCounter=221298496&in_version=&in_jobDate=All&in_jobType=&in_residency=&in_graphic=&in_param=&in_searchbox=YES&in_recruiter=&in_jobreference=&in_orderby=&in_sessionid=&in_navigation1=&in_summary=S"> that can be found on their website</a> and <a href="https://au.gradconnection.com/employers/asio/jobs/asio-asio-technologist-graduate-program-2/"> also here.</a></p>
  <p>If the above links do not work here are two screenshots of the both sites that you can look at.</p>

  <h3>Technologist Graduate Program</h3>
  <p>A description of ASIO graduate program is that the successful candidate would be working for 12 month in a hand on, dynamic, challenging and fast-paced environment of tehnical work within one of the frontline intelligence agency in Austraia. The successful candidate would then be able to work in areas that can include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>working within the security of their ICT infrastructure</li>
    <li>helping in supporting cybersecurity investigations</li>
    <li>helping in conducting forensic analysis of digital media</li>
    <li>helping in evaluating Technical Surveillance Counter Measures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above are only some of the areas that the graduate could work in. This job is appealing to me as I would like to work with the governmment in protecting our citizens from cyber crimes through cyber security as I have facination in this area. </p>

  <p>Some of the skills that might be included is how to program as you would need to have the ability to check if any federal organisation has been compromised and to do that you would need to have some sort of experience in software programming that will enable you to see if there are any loop holes. Another skill would be the ability to learn about how computer security works so that we could see how individuals could hack into a system. The qualifications that you would need to be a successful candidate is that you would need to at least have a discipline in one or more of these degrees but they are not limited to these degrees.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Software Development</li>
    <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
    <li>Cyber/Information Security/ComSci</li>
    <li>Data Science & Analytics</li>
  </ul>

 <p> The skills that I have when dealing with technology that deals with computers is that I have the determination to work on a problem until I have figured out the problem and answer. With the added skills and experience that is coming from the bachelor of IT I will get the skills to program programs that can </p>


 <h2>Profile</h2>
 <h4>Myer-Brigg Type Indicator (MBTI) Test</h4>
 <img src="MBTI.png" width= "600"/>
 <p>After completing an online MBTI Test, I got the results of being an INFP which stands for Introvertrd, Intuitive, Feeling and Percieving.</p>
<h5>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</h5>
 <p>Through getting the results of INFP, I can see that I am introverted which is true as I am not good at starting a conversation with new people unless they start the conversation and I like to be alone. Intuitive as I am creative and  imaginative as well as as I can easiy build trust with others as I can umderstand how other feel and see me. Feeling as I have a somewhat knowing understanding of what others might be feeling and whether or not they should be disturbed, Percieving as I can easily percieve other for what they need even if I have never been through it.</p>
 <h5></h5>
 <p>With these results it shows that I will put my effort into the group by trying to help out and put my effort into helping complete the group work to the best of my ability. The only downfall is that I do not like getting my values threatened.<p>
 <p>When thinking of forming a group I would need to take into account of who I would be working with because some people that have oppisite personality can or do not work together it more on how I will percieve the person before working with them but at most times it the person that come up to me and not the other way around because I do not do well at making conversations but I do try and that usually only happens after I get to know the person. </p>

 <h4>Learning Style Test</h4>
 <img src="Learning Style Test.png" width="600"/>
 <p>After completing an online learning style test, I got the results of being a visual learner. Through these results I can see that I am more of a visual learner because I do better when I shown or write it out then I do when only hearing what is to be done or learnt. So many times I have to put what I have learnt into practice otherwise I do not learn it</p>
 <h5>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</h5>
 <p>These results are what I was expecting when doing this test because I do learn more when getting shown how to do it. This mean I learn more when I do hands on activity because of how I like to visually see how things are done then listening to the teacher explaining how it is done because when that happens it does not stay but leaves soon after. I need to repeatedly read over and write out notes for what I am studying to make sense of what is being taught to me.</p>
